# MaxPolyComponents

Audio components with UI / Internal pairs that are suitable for use in max poly~ patchers

At the moment these are Max For Live midi effects such as ADSR and LFO which im deconstructing into 2 parts : UI and Internal.

The UI part goes in the top level presentation of the patch and the Internal part can be put inside a poly~ patcher.

Hopefully this will make constructing polyphonic instruments in Max easier. Note these are being made specifically for Max NOT Max 4 Live (yet).
